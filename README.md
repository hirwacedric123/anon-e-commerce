## E-commerce Website ðŸ›’ðŸ’»

### Overview  
A fully responsive **E-commerce Website** designed to provide a seamless shopping experience. The project uses **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **SASS (SCSS)** for modular and scalable styling. This website is perfect for showcasing products, managing a shopping cart, and simulating checkout functionality.

### Features  
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).  
- **Product Catalog**: Displays items with images, descriptions, and pricing.  
- **Search and Filter**: Search for products and filter them by categories or price.  
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and update products in a dynamic cart.  
- **Checkout Simulation**: Mimics a checkout process (payment gateway integration optional).  
- **Dark Mode**: User-friendly toggle for light and dark themes.  
- **SASS Styling**: Utilizes variables, mixins, and nesting for reusable and efficient CSS.

### Screenshots
